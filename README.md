# Halo : Custom Edition
Just casually sharing a complete version of Halo CE.
Why you should use this version? here's why : 


**Custom Edition**

This one uses Custom Edition instead of Combat Evolved version because :
- Full custom maps support.
- Better netcodes, basically fixes latency issues.
- Few additional features for better multiplayer experiences.


**Singleplayer Campaign**

Yes, a fully playable Combat Evolved campaign on Custom Edition.


**v1.0.10 patch**

This is a very crucial official patch that adds/fixes a lot of stuffs including :
- Replacing Gamespy server services (since they're dead) to Bungie's server so you can play online matches.
- Fixes shit ton of graphical bugs, parsing bugs, memory bugs/leaks, server bugs and many other shits.


**Chimera**

Basically a mod for Halo CE that fixes A LOT of stuffs and adds even more stuffs, some of them includes :
- Automatic map downloading. Why downloading the custom map manually when Chimera can do it for you.
- FOV Fix. Basically fixed FOV issues with this game. You're gonna need this.
- Reduced DRM. Your friends can't join your server because of duplicated CD keys? now they can.
- Fast Loading. Literally in the name. It removes CRC32 hash checks so the map can be loaded faster.
- Interpolation. Most shit renders at 30 fps even though you're playing at higher fps. this shit fixes it.
- Removed update checks. Do you really expect this ancient game gonna get new update? lol.
- And more stuffs lol, just listed some of the very useful stuffs.



And that's about it. Interested? follow the guide below on how to download and play this shit.
